Well while you're here...

## Welcome, to my corner of the internet.

I've felt for a while now that I need a little space to call my own. And what with learning development and all I thought "_How hard could it be?_". 

Turns out, not at all. [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [a little Jekyll theme](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) and I'm good to go! Also Markdown, which I love.

I'll mainly be using this page as a blog/CV/database for my personal projects.  

Shoot me a message if anything interests you.
