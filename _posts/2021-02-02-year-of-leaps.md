Time to set a theme for 2021

# Picking a yearly theme

## What are themes?

Themes are a less defined form of 'New Year's Resolutions'. You pick a broad topic and make that the theme of the year.

The idea being that a theme prods you occasionally to help you make small achievable choices to improve yourself.

Year of Health? I'll have yogurt instead of sugary cereals for breakfast. A simple change, but many small changes can snowball.

The idea comes from CGP Grey, who explains it best:

## 2020 - that happened

2020 was a -heck- of a year and my theme at the time, Year of The Forge, was aimed at honing my body, mind and skill set for a new career as a software engineer.

I'd switched away from the legal field (degree and all), into developing software 2 years prior and this was finally the time to show my stuff! üéâ

Then well, _the thing_ happened and my partner and I's plans to move to London were put on hold.

But through all that I was still intent on forging myself so I picked up running (physical fitness was almost medicinal during lockdowns), did algorithm questions, and went about organising some things in my life.

## 2021 - The Year of Leaps

Now it's time to pick a new theme.

So this year, starting from a more solid foundation, I want to take some risks. Take a leap.

üìù Definition of _leap_

- to spring free
- sudden transition or passage
- to increase, improve or grow quickly

To begin, I've outlined some thoughts on what the best case scenario would be.

üéñ Ideal Outcomes

- look & ultimately find a job somewhere in London
- be able to run 5K without stopping
- every time I choose programming over procrastination is a win
- start a personal project

And so it begins! Wish me luck.
