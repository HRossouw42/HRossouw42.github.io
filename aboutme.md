Hi! Iâ€™m Harmun and Iâ€™m a human being who makes computers do things.

## History

My spark for code ignited when I did my first little Java tutorial:  
I was working for a friendâ€™s startup as I plotted my lifeâ€™s course after getting a B.A in Law, but I never felt like the course would lead anywhere truly meaningful for me. So I coded along with a video tutorial, when suddenly, it clicked.

This is what Iâ€™ve been missing! Creativity and problem solving. Where I can break things (in a separate git branch ðŸ˜’) and put them back together better than ever before. Here is something that incorporates all of my passions.

## Current

Iâ€™ve spend the last several years surging forwards, utilising my diverse background to enter the wonderful world of tech and software. The innovative peer-to-peer based education at [WeThinkCode\_](https://www.wethinkcode.co.za/) not only sharpened my programming, but honed my interpersonal skills and led me towards an amazing opportunity to work on open source projects at [Coil](https://coil.com/).

## Future

Preparing to move back to London from Cape Town this year.
